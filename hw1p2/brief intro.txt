Everytime when the sender(maybe server or client) wants to send a message, it would randomly generate a 16-byte IV by calling os.urandom. Then it would put the IV at the very beginning of each message sent out. 

The format of data follows the instruction on Piazza, which is {iv, encrypted_len_of_msg, MAC(encrypted_len_of_msg), encrypted_msg, MAC(encrypted_msg)}.
